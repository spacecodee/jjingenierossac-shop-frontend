# Commit instructions

This document explains the commit message conventions used in this repository. Follow these rules to keep the change history clear, reviewable, and suitable for releases.

Quick summary

- We follow the Conventional Commits style: `type(scope): subject`.
- Write a short subject in imperative mood, no trailing period, recommended <=72 characters.
- Add an optional body that explains the why and the approach.
- Use the footer for issue references and breaking change notes.

Valid commit types

- feat: A new feature or module.
- fix: A bug fix.
- docs: Documentation only changes.
- style: Formatting, whitespace, missing semicolons, etc. (no code changes).
- refactor: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.
- perf: A change that improves performance.
- test: Adding or fixing tests.
- chore: Maintenance tasks (scripts, tooling, small config updates).
- build: Changes that affect the build system or dependencies.
- ci: Continuous integration changes (workflows, actions).
- revert: Revert a previous commit.

Recommended scopes (aligned with project structure)

Use scopes to indicate the area affected. Suggested scopes:

- pronunciation-practice
- learning-analytics
- parent-feedback
- core/services
- shared/components
- shared/ui
- styles/tailwind
- infra (deploy, nginx, hosting)
- ci
- docs
- tests
- deps

Message format (template)

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Rules and recommendations

- `<type>` must be one of the valid types listed above.
- `<scope>` is optional but recommended for changes that target a specific module.
- `<subject>` should be written in imperative mood, using lowercase except for proper names or acronyms, no trailing period, and ideally under ~72 characters.
- The `body` should explain why the change was made and how it was implemented. Wrap lines at ~72 characters for readability.
- Use the `footer` for issue references (e.g. `Closes #123`) and breaking changes (`BREAKING CHANGE: description`).
- For breaking changes include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer and describe migration steps and impact.
- Avoid mixing multiple types of changes in a single commit; prefer multiple focused commits instead.

Project-specific examples

- New feature in the pronunciation practice module:

```
feat(pronunciation-practice): add phoneme-level feedback component

Add a presentational component that displays phoneme-level scores
and highlights mismatches. This component receives a score object
and renders a colored bar for each phoneme.

Closes #42
```

- Bug fix in analytics:

```
fix(learning-analytics): correct session duration calculation

Session duration was calculated using endTime-startTime but missing
timezone normalization which caused negative values in some cases.
Normalize times to UTC before diffing.

Closes #101
```

- Documentation change:

```
docs(readme): add environment handling and CI notes

Update README to explain build-time environment strategy and provide
a minimal CI example for production builds.
```

- Refactor core services:

```
refactor(core/services): extract http wrapper service

Move repeated http handling code into a small wrapper to centralize
error handling and reduce duplication across services.
```

- CI workflow change:

```
ci: add github actions workflow for build and deploy

Add a minimal workflow that installs pnpm, runs build:prod and deploys
the produced `dist/` to the configured host. Secrets must be provided
by the runner.
```

Dependency/build commit example

```
build(deps): bump dotenv-cli to ^10.0.0

Keep dev dependency up to date to ensure consistent local env
loading across machines.
```

Revert example

```
revert: feat(pronunciation-practice): add phoneme-level feedback component

This reverts commit abcdef1234567890.
```

Pull request guidance

- Ensure each PR contains focused commits with clear messages following this guide.
- If the PR implements a feature, the PR title may use the same format: `feat(scope): short description`.
- In the PR description summarize purpose, main changes, and migration steps if any.
- Add a checklist for QA steps, local tests, or schema migrations when applicable.

Best practices

- Prefer small, atomic commits.
- Do not mix style and logic changes in the same commit; separate `style` from `feat`/`fix` commits.
- Sign commits if your workflow requires it (`git commit -S`).
- Use `git rebase -i` to clean up local commits before opening a PR when appropriate.
- Enforce conventions in CI or with git hooks (husky + commitlint) if desired.

Useful templates

- Short header: `type(scope): subject` (imperative)
- Body: provide the why and how
- Footer: `Closes #<issue>` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` when applicable

Minimal copy-paste example

```
feat(shared/components): add badge component

Add a small, accessible badge component used across the UI. It
supports color variants and small/large sizes.

Closes #88
```
